# Arduino Based Submersible Garbage Bin Project

This project was developed targetting a hackathon in order to develop a submersible garbage bin which would emerge from the underground compartment only when a button is pressed.
It also has GSM connectivity component where the authorities can check the garbage level by simply sending a SMS to the module and it will also trigger alerts when the bin is full
